Random small projects, simulations

Blackjack counting cards; how much would counting actually help? Does it significantly increase your odds of winning? Can we develop a better strategy than simple +1/-1/0 counting to get a better outcome? (this project is purely academic)

Monty Hall problem; Does the Monty Hall solution hold up to experimentation? (yes, it holds up to my numerical experiments, at least). Can we generalize a solution to multiple doors and multiple cars, and find a decision boundary in num_cars and num_doors space that will give the optimal outcome given those parameters.
